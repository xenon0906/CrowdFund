## Demo Script for Teacher

### Setup Before Demo (5 minutes)

1. **Prepare 3 Browser Windows:**
   - Window 1: Your main presenter account
   - Window 2: Incognito mode (different wallet)
   - Window 3: Another browser (teacher can use)

2. **Have Ready:**
   - Your deployed URL
   - 2-3 MetaMask wallets with Sepolia ETH
   - Contract address: `0x3015522014338929E2c7ddc438df092b993eFF38`

### Live Demonstration Flow

#### Part 1: Introduction (2 minutes)
"Good morning/afternoon. I'm presenting FundChain, a decentralized crowdfunding platform I developed using blockchain technology. Unlike traditional platforms like Kickstarter that charge 5-8% fees and control your funds, our platform is completely transparent, charges only network fees, and gives contributors voting rights on how funds are spent."

#### Part 2: Create Campaign (3 minutes)
**On Screen 1 (You):**
1. Connect wallet
2. Create new campaign
3. Set minimum contribution: 100 wei
4. Show transaction in MetaMask
5. Point out gas fees and transparency

"Notice how every action is recorded on the blockchain. This creates an immutable audit trail."

#### Part 3: Multi-User Interaction (5 minutes)
**Ask Teacher to Open the URL:**
"Professor, could you please open [YOUR-URL] on your device?"

**On Teacher's Device:**
1. They can view all campaigns without wallet
2. Show them how to connect MetaMask
3. Guide them to contribute to your campaign

**On Screen 2 (Incognito):**
1. Connect different wallet
2. Contribute to the same campaign
3. Show real-time balance update

"As you can see, multiple users can interact simultaneously. The blockchain ensures all transactions are synchronized."

#### Part 4: Voting Mechanism (5 minutes)
**On Screen 1:**
1. Create spending request as campaign owner
2. Enter: "Purchase development tools", 0.001 ETH

**On Screen 2 & Teacher's Device:**
1. View the spending request
2. Vote to approve
3. Show approval count updating

"This democratic voting ensures funds can't be misused. Contributors have real control."

#### Part 5: Technical Highlights (3 minutes)

**Show on Etherscan:**
- Open https://sepolia.etherscan.io
- Search your contract: `0x3015522014338929E2c7ddc438df092b993eFF38`
- Show all transactions are public

**Explain Security:**
- "Smart contracts are immutable - no one can change the rules"
- "All funds are held in the contract, not by any individual"
- "Voting threshold prevents single person control"

### Questions Your Teacher Might Ask

**Q: "What happens if someone loses access to their wallet?"**
A: "Unlike traditional systems, blockchain is permissionless. Lost wallets mean lost access, which is why secure key management is critical. This is a trade-off for decentralization."

**Q: "How does this scale for real-world use?"**
A: "Currently on testnet for demonstration. For production, we'd use Layer 2 solutions like Polygon or Optimism to reduce gas costs while maintaining security."

**Q: "What prevents fraud?"**
A: "The smart contract enforces all rules. Funds can only be withdrawn through approved requests with >50% contributor votes. Everything is transparent on the blockchain."

**Q: "Show me the actual code execution"**
A: Open the contract on Etherscan, show the contract code tab, explain key functions like contribute() and approveRequest()

## Testing Checklist for Multiple Users

Before your presentation, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Deploy to live URL (Vercel/Render)
- [ ] Access from 3 different devices/browsers
- [ ] Create campaign from Account A
- [ ] Contribute from Account B
- [ ] Contribute from Account C
- [ ] Create request from Account A
- [ ] Vote from Account B & C
- [ ] Finalize request
- [ ] Check all balances update correctly

## Backup Plan

If live deployment fails:

1. **Screen Share + Remote Access:**
   - Use Google Meet/Zoom
   - Share your screen
   - Give teacher remote control to interact

2. **Video Backup:**
   - Record a 5-minute demo video beforehand
   - Upload to YouTube (unlisted)
   - Have link ready as backup

3. **Local Network:**
   - If in same classroom/network
   - Share your local IP: `http://YOUR-IP:3001`
   - Others can access on same WiFi

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Real Blockchain:** "This is deployed on actual Ethereum testnet, not a simulation"
2. **Multi-User:** "Multiple people are interacting with the same smart contract right now"
3. **Transparent:** "Every transaction is visible to everyone, creating trust"
4. **Decentralized:** "No single server or company controls this"
5. **Democratic:** "Contributors vote on spending, not just the creator"

## Success Metrics to Show

During demo, highlight these numbers:
- Gas fees: ~0.001-0.003 ETH per transaction (show it's minimal)
- Transaction time: 15-30 seconds (explain block time)
- Multiple contributors: Show 3+ different addresses
- Voting participation: Show 100% can vote
- Zero platform fees: Compare to Kickstarter's 5%

## Final Tips

1. **Test Everything:** Run through entire demo 2-3 times before
2. **Have Backup Wallets:** Create 3 test wallets with ETH ready
3. **Prepare Answers:** Review the viva.md file for technical questions
4. **Show Enthusiasm:** Explain why blockchain matters for crowdfunding
5. **Keep it Simple:** Focus on user experience, not complex blockchain details

## Contact for Demo

If teacher wants to test before class:
- Share the deployed URL via email
- Provide this guide
- Offer to do a quick walkthrough on call

Remember: The goal is to show a working multi-user application that solves real problems with blockchain technology!
